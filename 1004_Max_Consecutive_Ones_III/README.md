# LeetCode Problem: Max Consecutive Ones III

## Problem Explanation

You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array, with the ability to flip at most `k` 0's to 1's.

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: You can flip at most 2 zeroes to ones to get the longest subarray of consecutive 1's. In this case, you flip the two 0's in the middle of the array to get `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]`, resulting in a length of 6 for the longest consecutive 1's.

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: You can flip at most 3 zeroes to ones to get the longest subarray of consecutive 1's. In this case, you flip the three 0's in the middle of the array to get `[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`, resulting in a length of 10 for the longest consecutive 1's.

## Solution

To solve this problem, you can use a sliding window approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution provided in the code:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l, max_count, zero_count = 0, 0, 0
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r] == 0:
                zero_count += 1
            while zero_count > k:
                if nums[l] == 0:
                    zero_count -= 1
                l += 1
            max_count = max(max_count, r - l + 1)
        return max_count
```

- Initialize `l`, `max_count`, and `zero_count` to 0. `l` represents the left index of the sliding window, `max_count` stores the maximum consecutive ones found so far, and `zero_count` keeps track of the number of zeros within the current window.

- Iterate through the `nums` array with a right pointer `r`. For each element in `nums`, if it's equal to 0, increment `zero_count` to count the number of zeros encountered.

- While `zero_count` exceeds the allowed flips `k`, move the left pointer `l` to the right to shrink the window and reduce the zero count. Continue this process until `zero_count` is less than or equal to `k`.

- Update `max_count` by taking the maximum of the current `max_count` and the length of the current window `r - l + 1`.

- Return the `max_count` as the final result, which represents the maximum consecutive ones achievable with at most `k` flips.
