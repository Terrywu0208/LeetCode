# LeetCode Problem: Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

## Problem Description

Imagine you have a group of kids, each with a certain number of candies. The number of candies each kid has is represented by an array called `candies`. Additionally, you have some extra candies that you can distribute among these kids. Your task is to determine, for each kid, if giving them all the available extra candies would make them have the greatest number of candies among all the kids. If this is true, the result for that kid will be `True`; otherwise, it will be `False`. Importantly, it's possible for multiple kids to have the greatest number of candies.

## Example

**Input:**
```python
candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]
extraCandies = 3
```

**Output:**
```python
[True, True, True, False, True]
```

**Explanation:**
- Kid 0: 2 candies + 3 extra candies = 5 candies (greatest).
- Kid 1: 3 candies + 3 extra candies = 6 candies (greatest).
- Kid 2: 5 candies + 3 extra candies = 8 candies (greatest).
- Kid 3: 1 candy + 3 extra candies = 4 candies (not greatest).
- Kid 4: 3 candies + 3 extra candies = 6 candies (greatest).

## Solution Explanation

To solve this problem efficiently, you can use a simple and concise Python solution. Here's an explanation of the provided solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        max_candies = max(candies)
        return [(i + extraCandies) >= max_candies for i in candies]
```

1. **Find the Maximum Candies**: First, the code calculates the maximum number of candies among all the kids using the `max(candies)` function. This maximum value (`max_candies`) represents the highest number of candies any kid currently has.

2. **List Comprehension**: The solution uses a list comprehension to iterate through the `candies` list, where `i` represents the number of candies a specific kid has.

3. **Comparison with Maximum**: For each kid's candies count `i`, it checks if adding `extraCandies` to `i` would make their total candies greater than or equal to the `max_candies`. If this condition is met, it assigns `True` to that kid, indicating they would have the greatest number of candies after receiving the extra candies. Otherwise, it assigns `False`.

By using list comprehension, the code efficiently constructs the `result` list without the need for explicit `append` operations in a loop. Additionally, it calculates the `max_candies` value only once, reducing redundant calculations and improving performance for larger input lists.

## WHY List Comprehensions faster then appending in loop !

The reason that using a list comprehension like `[(i + extraCandies) >= max_candies for i in candies]` can be faster than using `append` in a loop is due to the inherent optimization of list comprehensions in Python and the reduction in function call overhead.

1. **List Comprehensions Are Optimized**: List comprehensions are a more concise and often more optimized way of creating lists in Python. They are implemented in CPython (the standard Python interpreter) as a C loop, which is typically faster than a Python `for` loop.

2. **Avoiding Appending in a Loop**: In the original code where you used `append` in a `for` loop, you are repeatedly calling the `append` method, which has some overhead associated with it. Each `append` operation involves a function call, which can add up if you're iterating over a large list. In contrast, list comprehensions construct the list directly without the need for explicit `append` calls in Python code.

3. **Reduced Maximum Calculation**: In your original code, you calculate the maximum value in the `candies` list for each iteration of the loop. This involves traversing the list and finding the maximum repeatedly, which is inefficient. In the optimized code, we calculate the maximum value (`max_candies`) only once and then use it in the list comprehension. This eliminates the need to recalculate the maximum in every iteration.

While the difference in performance may not be substantial for small input lists, it can become more noticeable as the size of the input list increases. Overall, using list comprehensions and avoiding redundant calculations can lead to more efficient code.
