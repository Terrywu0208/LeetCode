# LeetCode Problem: Can Place Flowers

## Problem Statement
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `True` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, and `False` otherwise.

## Problem Explanation
You are given a flowerbed represented as an array of 0s and 1s. A '0' in the array represents an empty plot, and a '1' represents a plot that already has a flower. You need to determine if you can plant `n` new flowers in the flowerbed, following the rule that no two adjacent plots can have flowers.

## Example

**Input:**
```python
flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
n = 1
```

**Output:**
```python
True
```

**Explanation:** You can plant one flower in an empty plot without violating the rule.

**Input:**
```python
flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
n = 2
```

**Output:**
```python
False
```

**Explanation:** You cannot plant two flowers without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        # Create a new flowerbed with 0s added to the beginning and end
        fl = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        tmp_num = 0
        for i in range(1, len(fl)-1):
            # Check if the current plot and its neighbors are empty
            if fl[i] == 0 and fl[i-1] == 0 and fl[i+1] == 0:
                # Plant a flower and increment the count
                fl[i] = 1
                tmp_num += 1
        # Check if the number of planted flowers is greater than or equal to n
        return tmp_num >= n
```

## Solution Explanation

1. To solve this problem, we create a new flowerbed `fl` by adding a '0' at the beginning and end of the input flowerbed. This allows us to simplify the boundary conditions when checking adjacent plots.

2. We initialize a variable `tmp_num` to keep track of the number of flowers we have planted so far.

3. We then iterate through the elements of the `fl` array from the second element to the second-to-last element (ignoring the added '0's at the beginning and end).

4. Inside the loop, we check if the current plot and its neighbors are all empty (i.e., equal to '0'). If this condition is met, we plant a flower in the current plot (set it to '1') and increment the `tmp_num` counter.

5. Finally, after the loop, we check if the number of planted flowers (`tmp_num`) is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that it's possible to plant `n` flowers without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This solution works by iteratively checking each plot and its neighbors and planting flowers where possible. It ensures that no two adjacent plots have flowers, as required by the problem statement.
