## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this repository, you should have the following software installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or any other language you use for solutions)
- [LeetCode Account](https://leetcode.com/) (for accessing problem statements and testing your solutions)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```

3. Set up your development environment, if necessary.

## Usage

1. Browse through the problem directories to find the problem you want to solve.

2. Each problem directory contains:
   - A clear problem statement in a markdown (`.md`) file.
   - One or more solution files in your preferred programming language.

3. You can view the problem statement directly in the markdown file or visit the LeetCode link provided to get more details about the problem.

4. To run a specific solution, execute the corresponding code file with your chosen programming language.

5. Test the solution with your custom test cases or use the LeetCode platform to verify its correctness.

6. Feel free to contribute your solutions or improve existing ones by following the [Contributing](#contributing) guidelines.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
leetcode-solutions/
│
├── problem1/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
│
├── problem2/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
│
└── ...
```

- `problemX/` - Each problem has its own directory with a unique identifier.
  - `problem.md` - Contains the problem statement and description.
  - `solution.py` (or other language-specific extensions) - Contains the solution to the problem.
  - `README.md` - Additional information about the problem, approach, and any special notes.
