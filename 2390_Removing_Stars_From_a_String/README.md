# LeetCode Problem: Equal Row and Column Pairs

## Problem Explanation

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`. In one operation, you can:

- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Your task is to return the string after all stars have been removed.

**Note:**
- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
```
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
1. The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
2. The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
3. The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
```
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through the characters in the input string `s`. If the character is not a star, we push it onto the stack. If it is a star, we pop the top element from the stack, effectively removing the closest non-star character to the left of the star. After processing all characters in `s`, we can simply join the elements remaining in the stack to get the final result.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        
        for char in s:
            if char != "*":
                stack.append(char)
            else:
                stack.pop()
        
        return "".join(stack)
```


**Performance Difference Between `for` and `while` Loops in Python**

**Explanation:**

To explain the performance difference between `for` and `while` loops in Python, we need to consider the internal implementation and iteration mechanisms of Python.

1. **How `for` Loop Works**:
   - The `for` loop is primarily used to iterate over iterable objects such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more.
   - Python uses iterators behind the scenes to implement the `for` loop. This allows Python to optimize the iteration process as it knows how to traverse the iterable.
   - This design makes `for` loops typically faster than similar `while` loops because they do not require manual management of indices or counters, leveraging Python's built-in iteration mechanism.

2. **How `while` Loop Works**:
   - The `while` loop is a more general-purpose looping structure that can be used in various conditions.
   - In a `while` loop, you need to manage the loop control variable yourself (e.g., like the `l` variable in your first program), which can introduce additional operations.
   - Additionally, because the termination condition of a `while` loop may be more complex, it needs to perform a condition test during each iteration.

In summary, `for` loops are typically more efficient because they leverage Python's internal optimization mechanisms and do not require manual control of loop variables or condition testing. This is not to say that `while` loops are always slower than `for` loops, but in most cases, `for` loops are easier to write, understand, and offer better performance. However, performance can be influenced by various factors, including the specific loop contents and operations, so performance differences may vary in different scenarios.
