# LeetCode Problem: Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

## Problem Explanation

You are given a binary array `nums`, and your task is to delete one element from it. After removing one element, you need to find the size of the longest non-empty subarray that contains only 1's in the resulting array. If there is no such subarray, you should return 0.

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,0,1]`

Output: 3

Explanation: After deleting the number at position 2 (which is 0), the resulting array is `[1,1,1]`, which contains 3 numbers with the value of 1's.

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]`

Output: 5

Explanation: After deleting the number at position 4 (which is 0), the resulting array is `[0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1]`. The longest subarray with a value of 1's is `[1,1,1,1,1]`.

**Example 3:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`

Output: 2

Explanation: In this case, you must delete one element. So, after removing one of the 1's, the resulting array will have a length of 2.

## Solution

To solve this problem, you can use a sliding window approach. Here's how the provided solution works:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, max_count, zero_count = 0, 0, 0
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r] == 0:
                zero_count += 1
            while zero_count > 1:
                if nums[l] == 0:
                    zero_count -= 1
                l += 1
            max_count = max(max_count, r - l)
        return max_count
```

This solution uses three variables: `l` to represent the left boundary of the window, `max_count` to store the length of the longest subarray, and `zero_count` to count the number of zeros within the current window.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize `l` (left boundary), `max_count` (maximum subarray length), and `zero_count` to 0.

2. Iterate through the binary array using a pointer `r` that moves from left to right.

3. If the current element at `nums[r]` is 0, increment `zero_count`.

4. While `zero_count` is greater than 1 (meaning there are more than one zero within the window), move the left boundary `l` to the right until there's only one zero within the window.

5. Update `max_count` with the maximum length of the subarray (the difference between the current right pointer `r` and the left pointer `l`).

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the entire array, updating `max_count` as needed.

7. Return the maximum subarray length found.

This solution maintains a sliding window that ensures only one zero is present, and it tracks the length of the longest subarray containing only 1's. The final `max_count` value is the answer to the problem.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input `nums`, as it iterates through the array once.
