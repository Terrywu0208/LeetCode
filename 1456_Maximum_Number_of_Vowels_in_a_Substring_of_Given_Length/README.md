# LeetCode Problem: Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

## Problem Explanation

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to find the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with a length of `k`. Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

**Example:**

Input:
```
s = "abciiidef"
k = 3
```

Output:
```
3
```

Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters, which is the maximum for a substring of length 3 in the given string.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowel = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
        count = 0
        max_count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in vowel:
                count += 1
            if i >= k - 1:
                max_count = max(max_count, count)
                if s[i - (k - 1)] in vowel:
                    count -= 1
        return max_count
```

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We'll maintain a sliding window of length `k` and keep track of the count of vowel letters within that window. We'll slide this window through the string `s`, updating the count as we move.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a set `vowel` containing the vowel letters: `{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}`.
2. Initialize two variables: `count` to keep track of the current count of vowel letters in the window, and `max_count` to store the maximum count found so far, initially set to 0.
3. Iterate through the characters of the string `s` using a for loop.
4. Check if the current character `s[i]` is a vowel (i.e., it's in the `vowel` set). If it is, increment the `count` by 1.
5. Check if the window size has reached `k` (i.e., `i >= k - 1`). If it has, update `max_count` to be the maximum of `max_count` and `count`.
6. If the character at the beginning of the window (i.e., `s[i - (k - 1)]`) is a vowel, decrement the `count` by 1 since it is no longer in the window.
7. Continue iterating through the string until the end, updating `max_count` as necessary.
8. Return the `max_count` as the result, which represents the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of length `k`.
